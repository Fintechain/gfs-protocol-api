# TSEd Application Component Generation Execution Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Base Models
Core models and infrastructure must be established first as they are dependencies for other components.

### 1.1 Utils Module Base Components (Foundation)
1. [ ] Utils Services (LoggerService, CacheService, ConfigService)
2. [ ] Utils Middleware (LoggerMiddleware, ErrorMiddleware)

### 1.2 Auth Module Models (Identity Foundation)
1. [ ] User Model
2. [ ] Role Model
3. [ ] Permission Model
4. [ ] Session Model

### 1.3 Core Domain Models
1. [ ] Institution Models
   - Institution
   - InstitutionConfig
   - InstitutionHierarchy
   
2. [ ] Message Models
   - Message
   - MessageDraft
   - MessageValidation
   - MessageTransformation

3. [ ] Event Models
   - Event
   - EventSubscription
   - Notification
   - WebhookConfig

4. [ ] Blockchain Models
   - Transaction
   - Chain
   - Contract

5. [ ] Compliance Models
   - AuditLog

4. [ ] Compliance Services
   - AuditService
   - ReportingService
   - ComplianceService

## Phase 3: Middleware Components
Implement middleware that will handle cross-cutting concerns.

### 3.1 Core Middleware
1. [ ] Auth Middleware
   - AuthenticationMiddleware
   - RoleMiddleware
   - SessionMiddleware

2. [ ] Logging and Error Middleware
   - RequestLoggingMiddleware
   - ErrorHandlingMiddleware

2. [ ] Message Middleware
   - MessageValidationMiddleware
   - MessageAuthMiddleware
   - MessageLoggingMiddleware

3. [ ] Compliance Middleware
   - AuditLoggingMiddleware
   - ComplianceCheckMiddleware

## Phase 4: Controllers
Implement API endpoints after all supporting components are in place.

### 4.1 Core Controllers
1. [ ] Auth Controllers
   - AuthController
   - UserController
   - RoleController

2. [ ] Institution Controllers
   - InstitutionController
   - HierarchyController
   - PermissionController
   - ConfigController

### 4.2 Domain Controllers
1. [ ] Message Controllers
   - MessageController
   - ValidationController
   - TransformationController
   - SearchController

2. [ ] Blockchain Controllers
   - BlockchainController
   - TransactionController
   - ChainController

3. [ ] Event Controllers
   - EventController
   - SubscriptionController
   - WebhookController

4. [ ] Compliance Controllers
   - AuditController
   - ReportingController
   - ComplianceController

## Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure and Tests
Implement testing infrastructure and tests for all components.

### 5.1 Test Infrastructure
1. [ ] Base Test Configuration
2. [ ] Test Containers Setup
3. [ ] Test Factories Setup
4. [ ] Test Utilities and Helpers

### 5.2 Unit Tests
1. [ ] Model Tests
2. [ ] Service Tests
3. [ ] Controller Tests
4. [ ] Middleware Tests

### 5.3 Integration Tests
1. [ ] API Integration Tests
2. [ ] Service Integration Tests
3. [ ] Database Integration Tests
4. [ ] External Service Integration Tests

### 5.4 Performance and Security Tests
1. [ ] Performance Test Suite
2. [ ] Security Test Suite
3. [ ] Load Test Suite
4. [ ] Stress Test Suite

## Execution Notes

### Dependencies
- Each phase depends on the successful completion of the previous phase
- Components within each phase can be generated in parallel if they don't have direct dependencies
- Test generation should happen immediately after each component is generated

### Priority Order
1. Base infrastructure (Utils, Auth)
2. Core domain models
3. Core services
4. Middleware
5. Controllers
6. Tests

### Generation Request Order
For each component:
1. Generate the component using appropriate prompt
2. Generate tests using test prompt
3. Review and adjust generated code
4. Validate against requirements
5. Move to next component

### Quality Checks
After each generation:
- Verify TypeScript compilation
- Check code style consistency
- Validate OpenAPI documentation
- Verify test coverage
- Review error handling
- Check logging implementation

### Documentation Requirements
For each generated component:
- API documentation
- Method documentation
- Type documentation
- Usage examples
- Error scenarios
- Testing guidelines

## Tracking Progress

Use the following format to track progress:
```typescript
interface ComponentStatus {
  phase: string;
  component: string;
  status: 'Pending' | 'In Progress' | 'Completed' | 'Verified';
  dependencies: string[];
  startDate?: Date;
  completionDate?: Date;
  notes?: string;
}
```

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2 days
- Phase 2: 3 days
- Phase 3: 2 days
- Phase 4: 2 days
- Phase 5: 3 days
Total: ~12 days
