## 4. Interaction and Message Flow

1. The Message Controller receives an incoming HTTP request containing the ISO 20022 XML message.
2. The Message Controller extracts the message from the request body and invokes the Message Processing Service.
3. The Message Processing Service invokes the Validation Service to validate the message.
4. The Validation Service determines the appropriate validation pipeline based on the message type using the Validation Pipeline Factory.
5. The Validation Service executes the validation pipeline, passing the message through the validation stages.
6. If validation succeeds, the Message Processing Service invokes the Transformation Service to transform the message.
7. The Transformation Service determines the appropriate transformation pipeline based on the message type using the Transformation Pipeline Factory.
8. The Transformation Service executes the transformation pipeline, passing the message through the transformation stages.
9. After transformation, the Message Processing Service invokes the Processing Service to process the transformed message.
10. The Processing Service determines the appropriate processing pipeline based on the message type using the Processing Pipeline Factory.
11. The Processing Service executes the processing pipeline, passing the message through the processing stages.
12. During processing, the Processing Service may invoke the Blockchain Adapter to submit the processed message to the blockchain network.
13. The Blockchain Adapter serializes the message, constructs the transaction, and submits it to the blockchain network.
14. The Blockchain Adapter monitors the transaction status and waits for the transaction response.
15. Once the transaction response is received, the Blockchain Adapter returns it to the Processing Service.
16. The Processing Service returns the processing result, including the transaction response, to the Message Processing Service.
17. The Message Processing Service returns the processing result to the Message Controller.
18. The Message Controller prepares the HTTP response based on the processing result and sends it back to the client.

## 5. Error Handling and Logging

- Each component catches and handles exceptions that may occur during processing.
- Errors are logged with appropriate severity levels, including contextual information such as message type, message ID, and component name.
- Structured logging is employed to facilitate easy retrieval, searching, and analysis of log data.
- Errors are propagated to the caller component for appropriate handling and response generation.

## 6. Conclusion

The ISO 20022 Message Processing System provides a modular and scalable architecture for processing ISO 20022 financial messages and submitting them to a decentralized blockchain network. The system is composed of controllers, services, pipelines, stages, adapters, factories, and well-defined types and interfaces.

The controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, the services orchestrate the message processing flow, the pipelines and stages perform specific processing tasks, the adapters interact with external systems, the factories create pipeline instances, and the types and interfaces define the contracts and data structures used throughout the system.

By leveraging this architecture and adhering to the defined interaction and message flow, the system ensures efficient, accurate, and extensible processing of ISO 20022 messages while providing flexibility for future enhancements and customization.
